                <p>
                    After an unknown period of time after the events of Breath of the Wild, Link and Zelda are exploring
                    a secret passage hidden beneath Hyrule Castle. Although King Rhoam had warned Zelda in the past that
                    not even the royal family was to go there, she believes that what lies beneath is connected to the
                    strange phenomenon spreading throughout Hyrule known as "Gloom". As they travel, they find ancient
                    ruins that Zelda identifies as being of Zonai origin. They eventually find a mural depicting a great
                    war against the being called "the Demon King", the stories of which had been passed down by the
                    royal family. Another mural shows the Zonai descending which causes Zelda to realize that the "gods"
                    that descended from the heavens to found the royal family must have been the Zonai.

                    In the deepest chamber, Link and Zelda find a mummified Ganondorf emanating Gloom bound by a
                    disembodied arm. As they enter, the arm falls off and drops a teardrop-shaped gem. As Zelda picks it
                    up, Ganondorf comes to life and strikes with a surge of Gloom. Link blocks the attack with the
                    Master Sword, but Ganondorf's dark power decays the blade, saps Link's strength, and leaves his
                    right arm blackened and weakened. Ganondorf reveals that he knows Link and Zelda and mocks the
                    former's inability to harm him, mentioning that someone called "Rauru" had entrusted him.

                    Ganondorf sends a surge of Gloom that causes Hyrule Castle to rise into the sky before falling deep
                    underground. Zelda falls into a chasm, as Link drops the used-to-be Master Sword and attempts to
                    catch Zelda, only for her disappear in a flash of light. Link nearly falls in as well, but he is
                    grabbed by the disembodied arm and teleported away. When he reawakens, he finds that the arm has
                    replaced his own. A voice says that Zelda had told him about Link, and that Link's arm had to be
                    replaced to ensure he did not die from his injuries. Recovering the Decayed Master Sword, he leaves
                    the chamber he woke up in to find himself on an island floating in the sky. He descends to another
                    island, meeting a Steward Construct who gives him Zelda's Purah Pad at her request. It directs Link
                    to the Temple of Time, but upon reaching it Link finds that he cannot enter. He then meets a ghostly
                    figure identifying himself as Rauru, who informs Link that the arm he now possesses was once his own
                    and that its power might be restored if Link visits three of the shrines on the island and gain
                    their sacred light. After opening the gate, Link finds a larger teardrop-shaped gem that changes
                    into an apparition of Zelda, granting him the Recall power before vanishing. Link's path is then
                    blocked by a second sealed door, which he lacks the vitality to open. Rauru advises Link to visit
                    the island's last shrine and offer it to their Goddess Statue, which will restore some of the
                    vitality he lost to the Gloom. After doing so, Link is able to open the door. Rauru advises Link to
                    continue visiting shrines to recover his strength before passing on, telling Link that it will be up
                    to him to aid Zelda.
