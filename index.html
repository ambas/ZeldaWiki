                    After an unknown period of time after the events of Breath of the Wild, Link and Zelda are exploring
                    a secret passage hidden beneath Hyrule Castle. Although King Rhoam had warned Zelda in the past that
                    not even the royal family was to go there, she believes that what lies beneath is connected to the
                    strange phenomenon spreading throughout Hyrule known as "Gloom". As they travel, they find ancient
                    ruins that Zelda identifies as being of Zonai origin. They eventually find a mural depicting a great
                    war against the being called "the Demon King", the stories of which had been passed down by the
                    royal family. Another mural shows the Zonai descending which causes Zelda to realize that the "gods"
                    that descended from the heavens to found the royal family must have been the Zonai.

                    In the deepest chamber, Link and Zelda find a mummified Ganondorf emanating Gloom bound by a
                    disembodied arm. As they enter, the arm falls off and drops a teardrop-shaped gem. As Zelda picks it
                    up, Ganondorf comes to life and strikes with a surge of Gloom. Link blocks the attack with the
                    Master Sword, but Ganondorf's dark power decays the blade, saps Link's strength, and leaves his
                    right arm blackened and weakened. Ganondorf reveals that he knows Link and Zelda and mocks the
                    former's inability to harm him, mentioning that someone called "Rauru" had entrusted him.
