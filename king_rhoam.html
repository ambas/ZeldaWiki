                    King Rhoam was once the king of Hyrule Kingdom and the father of Princess Zelda, one century prior
                    to Link's awakening in the Shrine of Resurrection. Most of the information on King Rhoam's life is
                    detailed in King Rhoam's Journal and in Recovered Memories.

                    When his daughter was born, King Rhoam decided to name her Zelda, as is the tradition of the Royal
                    Family of Hyrule. Following such an occasion, he decided to begin writing down his life
                    story.

                    Prior to the second Great Calamity, a fortune teller predicted the revival of Calamity Ganon, so
                    King Rhoam ordered the excavations that uncovered the Guardians and the Divine Beasts. As
                    more Ancient Technology was revealed, King Rhoam became certain that the prediction would come
                    true. While he was concerned that investigating the relics would take time, he noticed that
                    Princess Zelda displayed an interest in research. During this process, King Rhoam learned about
                    about a princess with a sacred power and her appointed knight who was chosen by the Master
                    Sword With the power of the Guardians and the Divine Beasts, they were able to seal Calamity
                    Ganon.
